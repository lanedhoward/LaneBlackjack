Blackjack game for C++ 1 class.
The assignment was to make a blackjack game between player and dealer, run it 100 times, and print the results.
This assignment actually went much better than I was expecting. Since I already had experience making card games from C# programming 2 earlier this semester, and I am more comfortable with C++ after the Battleship assignment, making Blackjack in C++ was relatively straightforward.
